# RedditModTools

You will need to [create an app](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) in Reddit to use the scripts here. Then, copy `praw.template.ini` to `praw.ini` and fill it in.

Python 3.x is assumed, with the module `praw` installed.

## TODO

- Some sort of packaging - conda? venv?
- Use only one reddit app for everyone (requires OAuth)
- `quality_reports.ipynb` is a pile of poop, rewrite it as a script
- Rewrite everything in F#/.NET Core (okay maybe not)
